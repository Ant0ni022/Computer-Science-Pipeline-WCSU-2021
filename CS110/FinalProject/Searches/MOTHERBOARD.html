<h1>What was the first motherboard?</h1>
<p>
    The first motherboard is considered to be one used in the IBM Personal<br>
    Computer, released in 1981. At the time, IBM called it a "planar" instead<br>
    of a motherboard. The IBM Personal Computer and the motherboard inside<br>
    it would set the standard for IBM-compatible computer hardware going<br>
    forward.
