<h1>GPU</h1>
<hr>
<p>Short for graphics processing unit, GPU is an electronic circuit<br>
    used to speed up the creation of both 2D and 3D images. GPUs<br>
    can either be integrated, meaning they are built into<br>
    the computer's CPU or motherboard, or dedicated, meaning they are<br>
    a separate piece of hardware known as a video card. By having a<br>
    separate processor, the GPU allows the computer's CPU resources<br>
    to be used for other important tasks. In the picture, is an<br>
    example of a GPU on a video card without the heat sink.</p>
