<p id="Paragraph1">But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
of a pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain
some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
    avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>

<p id="Paragraph2">On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure
of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when
nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims
of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other
    greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
