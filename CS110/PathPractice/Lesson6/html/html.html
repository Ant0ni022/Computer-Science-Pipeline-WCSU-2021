<p>The Porsche 918 Spyder is a mid-engined plug-in hybrid sports car
    manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche. The
    Spyder is powered by a naturally aspirated 4.6-litre V8 engine,
    developing 616 PS (608 bhp; 453 kW), with two electric motors
    delivering an additional 283 PS (279 bhp; 208 kW) for a combined
    output of 899 PS (887 bhp; 661 kW). The 918 Spyder's 6.8 kWh lithium-ion
    battery pack delivers an all-electric range of 19 km (12 mi) under the
    US Environmental Protection Agency's five-cycle tests.</p>

    <p>Production began on September 18, 2013, with deliveries initially
    scheduled to begin in December 2013, and a starting price of ~ €611,000
    (US$845,000 or GB£511,000). The 918 Spyder was sold out in
        December 2014 and production ended in June 2015.</p>

    <p>The 918 Spyder was first shown as a concept at the 80th Geneva
    Motor Show in March 2010. On July 28, 2010, after 2,000 declarations
    of interest, the Supervisory Board of Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, Stuttgart,
    approved series development of the 918 Spyder. The production version was
    unveiled at the September 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. Porsche also unveiled
    the RSR racing variant of the 918 at the 2011 North American International
    Auto Show, which combines hybrid technology first used in the 997 GT3 R Hybrid,
    with styling from the 918 Spyder. The 918 Spyder was the second plug-in
    hybrid car from Porsche, after the 2014 Panamera S E-Hybrid.</p>
