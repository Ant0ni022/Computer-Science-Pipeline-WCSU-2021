<p><i>Bethel, CT</i> The new year begun at midnight and with dawned our hopes for an interesting year.
    As we bid farewell to 2020, we <br>
    have no regrets at its passing. We hope that the boring sameness that characterized that tedious year
    will never be repeated. The<br>quiet calm demeanor of politicians as they carried out their tasks of governing , the
dignified and respectful reporting from the<br>media, the silent advance of peace throughout the world, the exemplary behavior of leaders
from the worlds of entertainment and<br>industry...pardon us as we stifle yet another yawn...</p>
<p>At the very least the weather of the last few days has provided some welcome relief from the ubiquitous boredom<br>
    The temperatures observed in the Northeast have been some of the very highest on record.
    The revelers in Times Square in New York<br> City certainly appreciated being able to doff coats and hats
    for shorts and tank tops as they awaited the 73<sup>rd</sup> annual dropping of<br> the Tiffany ball.Is it reported
    that sales of sodas and other cold drinks topped expectations by a substantial margin In Russia,<br>
    enthusiasts usher & in the new year with an impromptu sailboat race on the Neva ver In northern Japan, sun bathers crowded<br> beaches and atop
    Mount Everest a hip-hop dance parry reverberated until the wee hours
